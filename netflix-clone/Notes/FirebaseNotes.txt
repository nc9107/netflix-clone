# Setting up payments with Stripe:
We have two different sets of keys: 
    Live and Test API key which allows us to test without real world actual transactions.

# Editing rules of firebase cloud storage is: 
    Helps us control access to authorized users to access their checkout sessions and subscription plans. 
    Inside of firestore collection, the stripe extension automatically populates the customer, their subscriptions 
    and pricing plans inside Firestore.

# Configure Stripe Webhooks:
webhooks are a way for apps to communicate between them automatically. An event-driven architecture being a software 
promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. An event can be defined as “a significant 
change in state.”

You need to set up a webhook that synchronizes relevant details from Stripe with your Cloud Firestore. 
This includes product and pricing data from the Stripe Dashboard, as well as customer's subscription details.
If a product is updated, deleted, etc. we need to send an event to the firebase application.
